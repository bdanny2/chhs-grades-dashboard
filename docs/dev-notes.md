# Developer Notes

## To Do
- [ ] Add login/auth system
- [ ] Sync conduct codes from Moodle (if applicable)
- [ ] Parent view restriction by student
- [ ] Term-based locking of grades
- [ ] Export reports to PDF

## Ideas
- Use Firestore for auth/session
- Add AI summarizer for teacher comments
- Auto-flag students below 50% in Math/English

## Dev Notes
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid tracking `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
- Add comments to `base_ui.py` and `main.py` for maintainability
